# rpi_server
Formerly, I was using this branch to experiment with new features. Later I realized that not all features run on the cloud. Since then, I've been using this branch to write non-essential innovative features that operate on raspberry pi 4. This repo handles the communication between kdb and python and is a part of the three repos that the bot uses. Checkout the other two:

* [Scheduler](https://github.com/8wgf3b/rpi_server)
* [kdb side](https://github.com/8wgf3b/time-and-time-again)
