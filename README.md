# rpi_server
The prime reason I started this project is to moderate my social media activity (like Reddit). Due to the lack of features in other platforms (like WhatsApp, Telegram), I switched over to discord. Slowly, this project scaled into something bigger, used by different servers. The main functions of the bot are scheduling tasks dynamically using cron like expressions and providing server analytics.

This repo handles the task scheduling side and is a part of the three repos that the bot uses. Check out the other two:

* [Python-kdb interface](https://github.com/8wgf3b/rpi_server/tree/magic)
* [kdb side](https://github.com/8wgf3b/time-and-time-again)
